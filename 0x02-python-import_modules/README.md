# Python - Import & Modules

This project explores Python's import and module system and covers various tasks related to this topic.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 0: Import a Simple Function from a Simple File

Write a Python program that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`.

### Task 1: My First Toolbox!

Write a Python program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, performs various math operations, and prints the results.

### Task 2: How to Make a Script Dynamic!

Write a Python program that prints the number of and the list of its command line arguments.

### Task 3: Infinite Addition

Write a Python program that prints the result of the addition of all command line arguments.

### Task 4: Who Are You?

Write a Python program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

### Task 5: Everything Can Be Imported

Write a Python program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

### Task 6: Build My Own Calculator! (Advanced)

Write a Python program that imports all functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and handles basic operations using command line arguments.

### Task 7: Easy Print (Advanced)

Write a Python program that prints `#pythoniscool` in the standard output. It should be a maximum of 2 lines long and should not use certain functions or commands.

### Task 8: ByteCode to Python #3 (Advanced)

Write a Python function `magic_calculation(a, b)` that does the same as a provided Python bytecode.

### Task 9: Fast Alphabet (Advanced)

Write a Python program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, without using loops, conditional statements, `str.join()`, string literals, or system calls.
