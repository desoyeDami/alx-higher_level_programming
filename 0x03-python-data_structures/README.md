# Python Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project explores Python's data structures, specifically lists and tuples. It covers a range of tasks and questions designed to help you understand these concepts and their applications.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this project, you will be able to:

- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Learn what lists are and how to use them.
- Identify the differences and similarities between strings and lists.
- Explore the most common methods for working with lists and understand how to use them.
- Learn how to use lists as stacks and queues.
- Understand list comprehensions and how to use them.
- Learn about tuples, their usage, and when to use them.
- Explore the concept of sequences in Python.
- Understand tuple packing and sequence unpacking.
- Learn about the `del` statement and its usage.

## Tasks

1. **Print a list of integers:** Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

2. **Secure access to an element in a list:** Write a function that retrieves an element from a list, considering negative indices and out-of-range indices.

3. **Replace element:** Create a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position.

4. **Print a list of integers in reverse:** Write a function that prints all integers of a list in reverse order.

5. **Replace in a copy:** Create a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

6. **Remove 'c' and 'C' from a string:** Write a function that removes all occurrences of 'c' and 'C' from a given string.

7. **Lists of lists = Matrix:** Create a function that prints a matrix of integers.

8. **Tuples addition:** Write a function that adds two tuples, considering possible missing values.

9. **More returns:** Create a function that returns the length of a string and its first character, with special handling for empty strings.

10. **Find the max:** Write a function that finds the largest integer in a list without using the built-in `max()` function.

11. **Only by 2:** Create a function that checks if each element in a list is divisible by 2 and returns a new list of True/False values.

12. **Switch:** Complete the provided source code to switch the values of two variables 'a' and 'b'.

13. **Linked list palindrome:** Implement a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

14. **CPython #0: Python lists (Advanced):** Create a C function that prints basic information about Python lists using the Python/C API.

## Requirements

- Python Scripts: Use allowed editors (vi, vim, emacs).
- C: Follow specific style guidelines and include function prototypes in a header file.
