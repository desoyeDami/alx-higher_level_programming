# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Overview

This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The goal is to understand the concepts of classes, objects, attributes, methods, and encapsulation.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the importance of Python programming and its strengths.
- Understand the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming.
- Define what a class is and how it relates to objects and instances.
- Differentiate between public, protected, and private attributes.
- Utilize the `self` keyword in Python classes.
- Comprehend the purpose of the special `__init__` method.
- Explore concepts such as Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
- Identify the difference between attributes and properties in Python.
- Implement Pythonic ways to write getters and setters.
- Dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances.
- Use the `__dict__` attribute of a class and/or instance.
- Understand how Python finds attributes of an object or class.
- Apply the `getattr` function.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several tasks, each building on the previous one:

1. **My first square**: Define an empty class `Square` in Python.

2. **Square with size**: Define a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`.

3. **Size validation**: Add validation to the `size` attribute, ensuring it's an integer and not less than 0.

4. **Area of a square**: Implement a public instance method `area` that returns the current square area.

5. **Access and update private attribute**: Add a getter and setter for the private `size` attribute.

6. **Printing a square**: Implement a public instance method `my_print` to print the square using the `#` character.

7. **Coordinates of a square**: Extend the `Square` class to include a private instance attribute `position` with a getter and setter.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code should adhere to the PEP 8 style guide (`pycodestyle` version 2.8.*).
- All modules, classes, and functions must have proper documentation in the form of docstrings.
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.

## Usage

To test the implementations, execute the provided main scripts for each task:
