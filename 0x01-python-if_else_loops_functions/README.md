# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project covers various Python programming concepts, including if/else statements, loops, functions, and more. It consists of several tasks aimed at improving your Python programming skills.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome.
- Understand the importance of indentation in Python.
- Use if and if...else statements for decision-making.
- Add comments to your code.
- Assign values to variables.
- Utilize while and for loops for iteration.
- Differentiate Python's 'for' from C's.
- Employ break and continue statements in loops.
- Use else clauses with loops.
- Understand the 'pass' statement and when to use it.
- Work with the range function.
- Define and use functions.
- Grasp the behavior of functions that don't use a return statement.
- Understand variable scope.
- Learn about traceback in Python.
- Use arithmetic operators and apply them in your code.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following tasks:

1. **Positive Anything is Better than Negative Nothing**
   - Determine if a random number is positive, zero, or negative.

2. **The Last Digit**
   - Print the last digit of a random number.

3. **The Alphabet Game**
   - Print the lowercase ASCII alphabet without newlines.

4. **Alphabet Soup**
   - Print the lowercase ASCII alphabet excluding 'q' and 'e' without newlines.

5. **Hexadecimal Printing**
   - Print numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal.

6. **00...99**
   - Print numbers from 0 to 99 with specific formatting.

7. **islower**
   - Check if a character is lowercase.

8. **To Uppercase**
   - Print a string in uppercase.

9. **Print Last Digit**
   - Print the last digit of a number.

10. **a + b**
    - Add two integers and return the result.

11. **a ^ b**
    - Compute a to the power of b and return the value.

12. **Fizz Buzz**
    - Print numbers from 1 to 100 with specific rules.

13. **Insert in Sorted Linked List**
    - Insert a number into a sorted singly linked list.

14. **Smile in the Mirror**
    - Print the ASCII alphabet in reverse order with alternating case.

15. **Remove at Position**
    - Remove a character from a string at a specific position.

16. **ByteCode -> Python #2**
    - Write a Python function that mimics a given Python bytecode.

## Getting Started

To run any of the tasks, execute the corresponding Python script. For example:

```bash
$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py
