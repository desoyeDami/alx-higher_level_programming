# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

This repository contains a collection of Python and C scripts, as well as a C function. The Python scripts cover various fundamental concepts and tasks in Python programming, while the C function checks for cycles in a singly linked list.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 0: Run Python file
Create a Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

### Task 1: Run inline
Create a Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

### Task 2: Hello, print
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line.

### Task 3: Print integer
Complete the provided source code to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by "Battery street," followed by a new line. You are not allowed to cast the variable `number` into a string.

### Task 4: Print float
Complete the provided source code to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits. You are not allowed to cast `number` to a string.

### Task 5: Print string
Complete the provided source code to print the string stored in the variable `str` three times, followed by its first 9 characters. You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.

### Task 6: Play with strings
Complete the provided source code to print "Welcome to Holberton School!" You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.

### Task 7: Copy - Cut - Paste
Complete the provided source code. You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements. `word_first_3` should contain the first 3 letters of the variable `word`, `word_last_2` should contain the last 2 letters of the variable `word`, and `middle_word` should contain the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters.

### Task 8: Create a new sentence
Complete the provided source code to print "object-oriented programming with Python," followed by a new line. You are not allowed to create new variables or use string literals. You are not allowed to use loops or conditional statements.

### Task 9: Easter Egg
Write a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python," by Tim Peters, followed by a new line. Your script should be a maximum of 98 characters long.

### Task 10: Linked list cycle
Write a C function `int check_cycle(listint_t *list)` that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it. Return 0 if there is no cycle, and 1 if there is a cycle. You are only allowed to use the following functions: `write`, `printf`, `putchar`, `puts`, `malloc`, and `free`.

### Task 11: Hello, write
Write a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line. Your script should print to stderr and exit with the status code 1.

### Task 12: Compile
Write a script that compiles a Python script file. The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`. The output filename has to be `$PYFILEc`.

### Task 13: ByteCode -> Python #1
Write the Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b):` that does exactly the same as the provided Python bytecode.
